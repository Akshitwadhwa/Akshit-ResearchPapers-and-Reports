# Akshit-Research-Papers-Reports
Welcome to my personal repository where I share my written reports, articles, essays, and technical write-ups on topics I’m passionate about. These documents may range from academic research and project documentation to opinion pieces and knowledge-sharing articles.
- **reports/**: Contains all my written work, each in its own folder for better organization.
- **.md/.pdf**: Files are either Markdown for easy viewing or PDFs for print-ready formatting.
- **assets/**: Optional images, diagrams, or datasets used in the articles.


Here are some example categories my writing might cover:
- 📊 Data Science & Machine Learning
- 💻 Software Engineering
- 🧱 Computer Architecture & Systems
- 🧠 Thought Pieces on Technology
- 🌍 Social Impact & Digital Ethics
